# smartCamera
Project for HackRU

This is software to use a webcam and a Rasberry pi to protect your home from burglars. This software uses computer vision and facial recognition to determine if a person entering your house is someone you want in there or not. Simply upload a couple of pictures of your trusted people, and this software will recognize who they are, and will send you a text telling you they got home safely. If a person is seen who doesn't have their face uploaded is spotted, the software will text you first, giving you a minute to cancel a potential call to the police. However, if you have friends over and they are not registered, don't fret, as long as they have someone who is registered with them when they are first seen by the camera, the software will automatically add them to the registered list.
